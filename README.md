## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I put on practice what i learn with bootstrap, and combine with my own css stylesheet , and i think it works great. Also thinks that bootstrap make the layouts and the responsive part a lot easier. This project teached me how specifity works on a better way because i had to inspect the links element and understand what class has priority to style, to modify the class to change the border color.

### Continued development

Bootstrap have a lot of classes, like A LOT a lot, so i think that knowing better the most importants classes is a challenge, but the practice makes better, so i will keep practicing with bootstrap a while.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/flex/) - This helped me to understand more about responsive design with bootstrap.
